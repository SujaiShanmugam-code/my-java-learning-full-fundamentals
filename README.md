# üíª My Java Learning !

Welcome to my Java repo! This is where I documented **everything I learned** while following a complete Java course. 

Throughout this journey, I‚Äôve tackled concepts from scratch ‚Äî from setting up Java on my machine to writing object-oriented programs, handling files, and even creating custom exceptions etc..

---

##  What I have Learned & Practiced

- Set up the Java development environment and understood how Java works behind the scenes.
- Learned and mastered **variables, data types, and user input handling**.
- Practiced writing **if-else**, **else-if**, **nested conditions**, and explored **ternary operators** for cleaner logic.
- Gained solid hands-on experience with **loops** including **for-loops, while-loops, do-while loops, and nested loops**.
- Built confidence with **arrays**, **for-each loops**, and **basic data handling**.
- Worked through multiple **coding challenges** that helped me apply the concepts in real-time.

##  Deep Dive into Core Java Concepts

- Built custom **classes and objects** and explored the power of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.
- Created and called **functions** with parameters and return types.
- Understood how **constructors** and **constructor overloading** work.
- Learned the importance of the **`this` keyword** and how it's used inside classes.
- Explored **inheritance** and different types of inheritance in Java.
- Strengthened my skills in **abstraction**, **interfaces**, and **polymorphism**.
- Understood how to use the **`super` keyword**, **access modifiers**, **static**, and **final** effectively.

##  Advanced Topics I have Explored

- Got comfortable with **exception handling**, including try-catch blocks, the `throw` and `finally` keywords.
- Wrote my own **custom exceptions** to understand error control better.
- Practiced **file handling** by reading and writing text files in Java.
- Learned how to work with **threads** and implemented multithreading using both `Thread` and `Runnable`.
- Dived into **lambda expressions** and explored their simplicity and power.
